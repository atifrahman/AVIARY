#### sequencing_evo.eps

A figure showing evolution of sequencing technologies used in http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2015/EECS-2015-186.pdf.

This was inspired by a figure in  
Reuter, Jason A., Damek V. Spacek, and Michael P. Snyder. "High-Throughput Sequencing Technologies." Molecular cell 58.4 (2015): 586-597. 

It shows how the amount of sequences that can be generated per $1000 has increased over the years. Circles are color coded by technology. The radii of the circles are proportional to log of read lengths and the border widths are proportional to error rates (times log of read length).
